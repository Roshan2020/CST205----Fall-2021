# Summary Report on the task above:
# Once I did one or two parts, I was able to complete both task 1 and 2 without any problems.
# I had a small issue if I had to mention it would be the constant check to see if I made the right amount of parentesis.
# In regards to the colour I tried and the result, I used the input examples in the word docx and I ran this file in repl.it and I got the expected result.
